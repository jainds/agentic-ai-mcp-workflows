# 🏥 Insurance AI PoC - Complete Deployment Summary

## 🎯 What We've Built

A comprehensive, production-ready Insurance AI proof-of-concept featuring:

### 🎭 Interactive UI Dashboard
- **Real-time Streamlit interface** for PoC demonstration and monitoring
- **Multi-agent chat interface** with dropdown selection between Support and Claims agents
- **Live LLM thinking process visualization** - watch AI analyze and respond step-by-step
- **Agent activity monitoring** - see all backend agent communications in real-time
- **API call visualization** - monitor HTTP requests/responses between services
- **Health status indicators** - real-time agent availability and metrics

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Support Domain Agent**: Customer inquiries, policy status, billing questions
- **Claims Domain Agent**: Claim filing, status checks, claims support
- **Technical Agents**: Customer data, policy data, claims data operations
- **LLM Integration**: OpenRouter API with primary/fallback model support

### 🔐 Security-First Approach
- **No hardcoded secrets** - all API keys from environment variables
- **Template-based deployment** - secure variable substitution with `envsubst`
- **Interactive setup script** - guides secure configuration
- **Git-ignored credentials** - `.env` file never committed
- **Kubernetes secrets** - secure cluster-based secret management

## 🚀 Quick Start (Complete Workflow)

### 1. Secure Environment Setup
```bash
# Interactive setup (recommended)
./scripts/setup_env.sh

# This will:
# - Create .env file from template
# - Prompt for OpenRouter API key
# - Save securely to git-ignored .env file
```

### 2. Deploy Everything
```bash
# Single command deployment
./scripts/deploy_k8s.sh

# This will:
# - Load API key from .env file
# - Build Docker images (agents + UI)
# - Deploy to Kubernetes with proper secrets
# - Wait for all services to be ready
```

### 3. Access Interactive Dashboard
```bash
# Open main interface
open http://localhost:30501

# Key features:
# 🎯 Agent selection dropdown
# 💬 Real-time chat interface
# 🧠 LLM thinking process visualization
# 🔍 Agent activity monitoring
# 📡 API call visualization
# 📊 Health status and metrics
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Through Dashboard (Recommended)
1. **Support Agent Tests**:
   - "I want to check my auto insurance policy status"
   - "How do I update my contact information?"
   - "When is my next premium payment due?"

2. **Claims Agent Tests**:
   - "I was in a car accident yesterday and need to file a claim"
   - "What's the status of my claim #12345?"
   - "What documents do I need for a home insurance claim?"

### Through Command Line
```bash
# Test LLM integration
python scripts/test_llm_integration.py smoke

# Test in Kubernetes cluster
kubectl exec -it deployment/support-agent -n insurance-poc -- \
  python scripts/test_llm_integration.py integration
```

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### ✅ Environment Variable Management
- API keys loaded from `.env` file or environment
- Template-based Kubernetes secret creation
- No hardcoded credentials anywhere in codebase

### ✅ Secure Deployment Process
```bash
# API key validation during deployment
if [ -z "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: API key required"
    exit 1
fi

# Secure secret creation
envsubst < k8s/manifests/secrets.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

### ✅ Best Practices
- Git-ignored `.env` files
- Interactive setup script for guidance
- Kubernetes secrets for cluster deployment
- Environment variable substitution
- No credentials in container images
