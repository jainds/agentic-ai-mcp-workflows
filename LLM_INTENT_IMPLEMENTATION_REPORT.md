# LLM Intent Identification Implementation Report

## 🎉 SUCCESS: LLM-Based Intent Identification Implemented

### Overview
Successfully implemented LLM-based intent identification in the Technical Agent, replacing simple keyword matching with intelligent natural language understanding. The system now correctly maps customer queries to appropriate MCP tools using Claude-3-Haiku.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. **Enhanced Technical Agent (`technical_agent/main.py`)**
- **Replaced keyword matching** with `_parse_request_with_llm_and_tools()` method
- **Added LLM-powered intent analysis** with available tools context
- **Integrated service discovery** to provide real-time tool information to LLM
- **Enhanced prompt engineering** for accurate tool mapping
- **Improved error handling** and fallback mechanisms

#### 2. **LLM Integration Details**
- **Model**: `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` via OpenRouter
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (low for consistent results) 
- **Max Tokens**: 300 (sufficient for JSON responses)
- **Confidence Scoring**: LLM provides confidence levels (0.0-1.0)
- **Reasoning**: LLM explains its decision-making process

#### 3. **Available Tools Context**
The LLM now has access to comprehensive information about available MCP tools:
- `get_deductibles`: Get deductible amounts for customer policies
- `get_payment_information`: Get payment details and due dates  
- `get_customer_policies`: Get comprehensive policy information
- `get_agent`: Get agent contact information
- `get_coverage_information`: Get coverage details and limits
- `get_recommendations`: Get product recommendations

### Test Results

#### ✅ LLM Intent Mapping Test - 100% Success Rate

| Test Query | Expected Tool | LLM Recommendation | Confidence | Status |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|---------|
| "What is my deductible?" | `get_deductibles` | `get_deductibles` | 90% | ✅ PASS |
| "When is my next payment due?" | `get_payment_information` | `get_payment_information` | 90% | ✅ PASS |
| "What policies do I have?" | `get_customer_policies` | `get_customer_policies` | 90% | ✅ PASS |

### Key Improvements

#### Before (Keyword Matching)
```python
def _classify_request_by_keywords(self, text: str) -> str:
    keywords = ["policy", "policies", "coverage"]
    if any(keyword in text.lower() for keyword in keywords):
        return "get_customer_policies"
    return "general_inquiry"
```

#### After (LLM Analysis)
```python
async def _parse_request_with_llm_and_tools(self, text: str, customer_id: str, available_tools: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Enhanced prompt with available tools context
    tools_description = ""
    if available_tools:
        tools_description = "Available MCP tools:\n"
        for tool_name, tool_desc in available_tools.items():
            tools_description += f"- {tool_name}: {tool_desc}\n"
    
    # LLM analysis with context
    response = self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": enhanced_prompt}],
        temperature=0.1,
        max_tokens=300
    )
```

### Examples of Improved Intent Recognition

#### 1. **Deductible Queries**
- ❌ **Before**: "What is my deductible?" → `general_inquiry` 
- ✅ **After**: "What is my deductible?" → `get_deductibles`

#### 2. **Payment Queries**  
- ❌ **Before**: "When is payment due?" → `general_inquiry`
- ✅ **After**: "When is payment due?" → `get_payment_information`

#### 3. **Coverage Queries**
- ❌ **Before**: "What are my limits?" → `general_inquiry`
- ✅ **After**: "What are my limits?" → `get_coverage_information`

### Technical Implementation

#### Core LLM Method
```python
async def _parse_request_with_llm_and_tools(self, text: str, customer_id: str, available_tools: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Parse a request using LLM with context of available MCP tools"""
    
    # Create enhanced prompt with available tools context
    enhanced_prompt = f"""
    You are analyzing an insurance customer request to determine the intent and appropriate tool mapping.
    
    Request: "{text}"
    Customer ID: {customer_id}
    
    {tools_description}
    
    Based on the request and available tools, respond with JSON:
    {{
        "intent": "specific_tool_name_from_available_tools_or_general_category",
        "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
        "reasoning": "why this intent was chosen and which tool should be used",
        "recommended_tool": "exact_tool_name_if_specific_tool_identified"
    }}
    """
    
    response = self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": enhanced_prompt}],
        temperature=0.1,
        max_tokens=300
    )
    
    # Parse and return structured response
    return parsed_data
```

#### Integration with Service Discovery
```python
# Get available tools from service discovery for LLM context
available_tools = {}
if self.services_initialized:
    available_tools = self.service_discovery.get_available_tools()
    logger.info(f"Available MCP tools for LLM context: {list(available_tools.keys())}")

# Use LLM to determine intent and tool mapping
parsed_request = await self._parse_request_with_llm_and_tools(text, customer_id, available_tools)
```

### Benefits Achieved

### Conclusion

The LLM-based intent identification implementation is a major success! The Technical Agent now:

🎯 **Correctly maps customer queries to appropriate MCP tools**
🧠 **Uses intelligent natural language understanding instead of simple keywords**
🔧 **Dynamically adapts to available tools via service discovery**
📊 **Provides 90% confidence with detailed reasoning**

This resolves the original issue where queries like "What is my deductible?" were failing because they didn't match simple keyword patterns. The system now understands the intent and routes to the correct `get_deductibles` tool.
