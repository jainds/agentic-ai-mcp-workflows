# Technical Agent and MCP Integration Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Logging Errors in User Service
**Problem**: The user service was using structured logging syntax with standard Python logging, causing `TypeError: Logger._log() got an unexpected keyword argument`.

**Fix**: 
- Fixed deprecation warning by replacing `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(UTC)`
- Added proper UTC import: `from datetime import datetime, timedelta, UTC`
- All logging statements now use proper f-string formatting instead of keyword arguments

**Files Modified**:
- `services/user_service/main.py`

### 2. "Policy ID Required" Error in Technical Agent
**Problem**: The domain agent was not passing customer context (`customer_id`) to the technical agents, causing the technical agent to fail with "Policy ID required for fetching details".

**Root Cause**: The `fetch_policy_details` action in the technical agent requires either a `customer_id` or `policy_id`, but the domain agent was only sending the action without customer context.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `create_execution_plan()` to accept and store `customer_id` parameter
- Updated `process_user_message()` to pass `customer_id` to execution plan creation
- Enhanced `execute_sequential_steps()` to include customer context in task data sent to technical agents
- Ensured customer_id is stored both at top level and in entities for backward compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `agents/domain/python_a2a_domain_agent.py`

### 3. JSON Parsing Error in Intent Analysis
**Problem**: The LLM was returning valid JSON followed by explanation text, causing `json.JSONDecodeError: Extra data` when parsing.

**Fix**: 
- Added robust JSON parsing that handles explanation text after JSON
- Implemented brace counting to extract complete JSON objects
- Added fallback parsing with regex for malformed responses

**Files Modified**:
- `agents/domain/python_a2a_domain_agent.py`

## Technical Details

### Customer Context Flow
```
User Request → Domain Agent → Intent Analysis → Execution Plan (with customer_id) → Technical Agent Task Data

Task Data Structure:
{
    "action": "fetch_policy_details",
    "customer_id": "CUST-123",
    "context": {
        "customer_id": "CUST-123",
        "intent": "policy_inquiry",
        "entities": {"customer_id": "CUST-123"},
        "urgency": "medium"
    }
}
```

### Execution Plan Enhancement
The execution plan now includes:
- `customer_id` at top level for easy access
- `customer_id` in entities for structured access
- Full context information for technical agents

## Testing Results

✅ User service starts successfully without logging errors
✅ Domain agent properly parses LLM responses with explanation text
✅ Customer context is properly passed from domain agent to technical agents
✅ Technical agents receive required customer_id for policy operations
✅ System maintains backward compatibility with existing agent interfaces

## Services Verified

- **User Service**: Running on port 8003 with FastMCP integration
- **Technical Agent**: Starts successfully and receives customer context
- **Domain Agent**: Properly handles intent analysis and execution planning

## Architecture Compliance

All fixes maintain alignment with the original architecture:
- Python A2A protocol compatibility preserved
- FastMCP integration remains intact
- Agent communication patterns unchanged
- Professional response templates functional
- MCP tool calling capabilities maintained

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for:
1. Full end-to-end testing with real MCP service calls
2. Integration testing between all services
3. Performance testing under load
4. Production deployment preparation
