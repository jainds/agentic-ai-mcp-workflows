    - Never include sections for unavailable information
    - Never mention information the customer didn't ask about unless directly relevant

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - If the customer asked about "policies", show policy overview
    - If they asked about "payments", focus on payment information  
    - If they asked about "deductibles", focus on deductible amounts
    - If they asked about "coverage", focus on coverage amounts
    - If they asked about "agent", focus on agent contact info
    - Don't include payment info if they asked about policies (unless specifically requested)
    - Don't include agent info unless they asked about their agent
    - Keep responses focused and relevant to the specific question
